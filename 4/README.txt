The additional special tile, BonusTile: All tiles in a 3-tile radius on the board 
are added to the player's score after this round.

I wrote specifications inside each diagram pdf, which are clear.

MileStone B Update:
I updated my special tile, called RevengeTile now, because this is more creative 
than the old one.

When the current player triggers the revenge tile, it will remove all the special 
tiles of the player that are already placed on the board.(not influence the 
holding special tiles)

How to play:
It is simple and obvious from my game UI. Clicking a tile and then click a location 
in board could place that tile into the square. Rules are the same as Scrabble online. 
Current player's background is marked as red. You can also retreat all your tiles 
placed in current round. There are some game option buttons on the right side, which 
are easy to understand. And the core instructions are listed on the left side. And 
the button on the lower part of the right side are the purchasing special tile buttons.

MileStone C Update:
I added the score switch tile, which will be explained in the discussion.
